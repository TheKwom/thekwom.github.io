        <h1>PARC: Alignment</h1>
        <h2>Nintendo</h2>
        <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/">nintendo.com</a>

            Here we see alignment in the name, release date, price and console for which
            the game is made. They are all left aligned perfectly, creating a strong line
            that is clearly noticable even though there isn't an actual line there.

        <h1>PARC: Proximity</h1>
        <h2>Best Buy</h2>
        <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com">bestbuy.com</a>
        <img src="images/bestbuy.jpeg" alt="Screenshot of best buy Website">
        <p>
            On this website we see the images of each product placed consistently to the left
            of their description, price and other information. Our mind notices the proximity
            and instantly realizes that those two things are related to one another.

        <h1>PARC: Contrast</h1>
        <h2>Apple</h2>
        <a href="https://www.apple.com">apple.com</a>
        <img src="images/apple.jpeg" alt="Screenshot of apple Website">
        <p>
            Something I have always loved about the Apple website is their use of colors and
            contrast. In this particular screenshot we see that nothing is difficult to read.
            The things that are more inportant, such as the name of the product and how to purchase
            it, stand out far more because of their contrast.
